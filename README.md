# Colored Cubes (Test Task for ICVR)

## Task Description
* We have static cube actors in the scene (3000 units) and a camera which moves along a spline.
* Cubes in FOV of the camera which are closer than R0 (some fixed distance to the camera) should become blue (But not more than L0=30 of the cubes).
* Cubes in FOV of the camera which are closer than R1 (R1 > R0) should become yellow (but not more than L1=100 of them).
* Predict the color of the cubes at some point of the spline before the camera gets there
* C++ is preferred, L0, L1, R0, R1 should be available to level designers in the Editor.
